     * While it is typically the case that:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * x.clone().equals(x)</pre></blockquote>
     * will be {@code true}, this is not an absolute requirement.
     * <p>
     * By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling

     * {@code x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()}.
     * <p>
     * By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
     * of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,
     * it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
     * by {@code super.clone} before returning it.  Typically, this means
     * copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
     * of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
     * objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only
     * primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
     * the case that no fields in the object returned by {@code super.clone}
     * need to be modified.
     * <p>
     * The method {@code clone} for class {@code Object} performs a
     * specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
     * not implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, then a
     * {@code CloneNotSupportedException} is thrown. Note that all arrays
     * are considered to implement the interface {@code Cloneable} and that
     * the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}
     * is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type.
     * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
     * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
     * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
     * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
     * performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
     * <p>
     * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface
     * {@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an object
     * whose class is {@code Object} will result in throwing an
     * exception at run time.

     *                                    that override the {@code clone} method can also
     *                                    throw this exception to indicate that an instance cannot

     * This method causes the current thread (call it <var>T</var>) to

     * The thread <var>T</var> is then removed from the wait set for this
     * object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It then competes in the

     * synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo
     * ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the {@code wait}

     * <p>
     * A thread can also wake up without being notified, interrupted, or
     * timing out, a so-called <i>spurious wakeup</i>.  While this will rarely
     * occur in practice, applications must guard against it by testing for
     * the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened, and
     * continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied.  In other words,
     * waits should always occur in loops, like this one:
